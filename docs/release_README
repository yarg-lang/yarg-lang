* Yarg-Lang 0.3.0 README

This release is a demonstrator, and not intended for development use. You could use it to recreate the 'hello_led' or 'hello_button' examples.

** Requirements

Yarg 0.3.0 runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico. It does not support the Pico W, or Pico 2/Pico 2W versions in this release.

** Installing

Mount the Pico as a USB drive, by plugging it in to a host with the 'bootsel' button depressed.

Copy yarg-lang-pico-0.3.0.uf2 to the drive, and it will reboot.

Yarg presents a serial based REPL over both the USB serial connection and UART1 on the Pico.
  
On my machine, that's available as /dev/tty.usbmodem1101 - your machine will vary.

Connect your favourite serial monitor (I use VSCode; putty and minicom are also popular) to your device, and press enter. You should see the prompt:

>

You can type:

> import("hello_led");

and the built in led should illuminate

** Extras

*** vscode plugin

extras/yarg-lang-0.3.0.vsix is a vscode syntax highligher for yarg. Install it via the 'Extensions: Install from visx...' command.

*** hostyarg

Use go install github.com/yarg-lang/yarg-lang/hostyarg@0.3.0 to install hostyarg.

You can use this to add yarg files to your image, for your own development, eg:

$ hostyarg addfile -fs yarg-lang-pico-0.3.0.uf2 -add my_yarg.ya

install the uf2 as above, and after the pico reboots, at the yarg prompt:

> import("my_yarg");

will execute your file.
